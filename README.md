This is my guide to Git for beginners who may not have experience with version/revision control systems and who may be using graphical clients.

The latest version is version 0.3, which contains what I've written in 2013 (covering most of the basics), converted to Markdown for pretty formatting. (It's still readable as a plain-text file.) Version 1.0 (planned for 30 June 2015) will cover more tools, such as revision modification (rebasing, etc.).
